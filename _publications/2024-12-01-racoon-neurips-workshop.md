We present RACOON, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs for accurate column type annotation in tabular data. Our approach combines retrieval-augmented generation with structured knowledge to improve the accuracy and consistency of column type identification across diverse datasets.
